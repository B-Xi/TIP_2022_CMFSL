Fig. 1: The architecture of the proposed CMFSL for HSIC. Based on the class-covariance metric, the classification process is completed by the episode-based collaboratively meta-training of the source and target data sets, and the episode-based meta-test of the target data set. Notably, the embedding feature extractor comprises a new SPRM and a novel LXConvNet.

Training and Test Process
--
1) Please prepare the training and test data as operated in the paper. And the websites to access the datasets are also provided. The used OCBS band selection method is referred to [https://github.com/tanmlh] (https://github.com/tanmlh).
2) Run "trainMetaDataProcess.py" to generate the meta-training data 
3) Run the 'CMFSL_UP_main.py' to reproduce the CMFSL results on [Pavia University](http://www.ehu.eus/ccwintco/index.php?title=Hyperspectral_Remote_Sensing_Scenes#Pavia_University_scene) data set.

We have successfully tested it on Ubuntu 16.04 with PyTorch 1.1.0. Below is the classification map with five shots of training samples from each class.
